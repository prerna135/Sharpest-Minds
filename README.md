# Sample code for sharpest minds application

This repo contains two folders. The image captioning folder contains code and instructions for running the code for an image captioning system implemented using CNN-LSTM architecture in Tensorflow. The gensim folder is a copy of my gensim local repository in which I have contributed to resolving sphinx issues (already merged) and adding a new model called sent2vec to Gensim (almost complete, just final evaluation left before merging).
