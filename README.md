# Sample code for sharpest minds application

This repo contains two folders. The image captioning folder contains code and instructions for running the code for an image captioning system implemented using CNN-LSTM architecture using Tensorflow. The gensim folder is a copy of my genesis local repository in which I have contributed to resolving sphinx issues and adding a new model called sent2vec to Genesis.
